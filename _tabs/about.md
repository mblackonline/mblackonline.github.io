Welcome to my new website, where I will share my journey transitioning from a healthcare background into a technology career while aiming to make a positive difference in the world. My name is Matt Black, and I’m a student at Western Governors University majoring in cloud computing. I have a passion for learning about and experimenting with new technologies, and I'm working to channel that enthusiasm into a new career.

Alongside my studies, I volunteer my time as the Operations Development Lead and co-CEO for [CD Tech Chattanooga](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cd-tech-chattanooga/) and as a Digital Coach with the [Community Tech Network (CTN)](https://communitytechnetwork.org/). I'm also proud to be a member of the [Chattanooga Technology Council (ChaTech)](https://www.chatech.org/).

One of my motivations for working in technology is to make a positive difference in the world. I believe technology can offer solutions for social and environmental issues, like enabling connections to reduce loneliness, empowering the disadvantaged with knowledge, and promoting improved healthcare. I hope to explore these topics in future posts and inspire others to join me in using technology for good.

I welcome your feedback, comments, and suggestions on how I can improve my website and my learning journey. You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewblack/) or follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mblackonline) to stay updated on my progress and connect with me.

Thank you for visiting my website and for your support.
