## About

Hello, I'm Matt Black, a technology professional who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Cloud Computing from Western Governors University in May 2024. After a career in healthcare, I've transitioned into the tech industry, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

I currently work as a Helpdesk Support Specialist at Rhea Medical Center, providing technical support and leveraging my skills in hardware, software, and networking.

I also volunteer with [CD Tech Chattanooga](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cd-tech-chattanooga/), helping to co-lead the group and empower individuals from non-traditional backgrounds to enter the tech industry through project building, learning, and networking. Previously, I served as a Digital Coach with the [Community Tech Network (CTN)](https://communitytechnetwork.org/), promoting digital literacy and helping individuals navigate the digital world.

This site is a space for learning and giving back to the community. I'll share insights from my projects, reflections on my experiences in the tech world, and updates on the latest technologies.

I believe technology has the power to create positive change—from fostering connections to empowering people with knowledge. I look forward to exploring these topics in future posts and hope to inspire others to leverage technology for good.

Join me on this journey, and let's learn and grow together in the tech field! Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewblack/) or follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mblackonline) to stay updated on my progress.
